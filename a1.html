    <p>Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions.[1] In classical physics, physical space is
    often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless
    four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime.[2] The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to
    an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is
    itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.</p>
    <p>n the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is
    conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general
    relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space.[3] Experimental tests of general relativity
    have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.[citation needed]</p>

    <p> he first partially successful lunar mission was Luna 1 in January 1959, which became the first probe to escape Earth's
    gravity and perform a flyby of another astronomical body, passing near the Moon. Soon after, the first Moon landing—and
    the first landing on any extraterrestrial body—was carried out by Luna 2,[1] which intentionally impacted the Moon on 14
    September 1959. The far side of the Moon, permanently hidden from Earth due to tidal locking, was imaged for the first
    time by Luna 3 on 7 October 1959, revealing terrain never before seen</p>
    <p>Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM), unofficially known as Mangalyaan[11] (Sanskrit: Maṅgala 'Mars', Yāna 'Craft,
    Vehicle'),[12][13] is a space probe orbiting Mars since 24 September 2014. It was launched on 5 November 2013 by
    ISRO.[14][15][16][17] It was India's first interplanetary mission </p>
    <p>The International Space Station (ISS) is a large space station that was assembled and is maintained in low Earth orbit
    by a collaboration of five space agencies and their contractors: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), ESA (Europe),
    JAXA (Japan), and CSA (Canada). As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for
    conducting scientific experiments in microgravity and studying the space environment.[</p>
    <p>The Space Shuttle is a retired, partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the
    U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program
    name was the Space Transportation System (STS), taken from the 1969 plan led by U.S. vice president Spiro Agnew for a
    system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development.[</p>
